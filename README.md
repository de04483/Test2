Description: I have followed the videos instructions on how to proceed with Test 2. I have downloaded the necessary files. I have setup GitHub Repository, and I have created and assigned the issues. I got a little to carried away and added my orgianl issues to 'Done' early and so created a new round of issues that is why their numbers are higher than they need to be. I have proceeded with adding the necessary code to the CustomerOrderTest file and created the necessary branches for each section. I have merged the braches as well. While in the process of committing the files, I had a few unexpected errors. Two commits were committed straight to the main branch instead of the branches. I'm not sure why this happened as I did the same thing for every file but only those two had isssues. When merging the fiels together I believe GitHub merged the main branch into my last branch by mistake. I believe that is everything that was covered in the Intsruction Video.
